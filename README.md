# CodeChronicle: Visualizing the Story of Code

![Project Status: Blueprint](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-blueprint-blue)

## The Cathedral Concept

CodeChronicle is an advanced data visualization platform designed to analyze and bring to life the entire history of a large open-source GitHub repository. Instead of a static view of code, users can explore the dynamic, evolving story of its creation, collaboration, and architecture.

This project is a "Cathedral-Class" portfolio piece designed to showcase elite skills in data-intensive backend processing and high-end frontend data visualization with D3.js.

### Core Architectural Pillars
*   **Data Ingestion & Processing Pipeline:** A powerful Node.js backend service that uses the GitHub API to fetch the entire commit and pull request history of a target repository, processing and storing the massive dataset in a highly optimized PostgreSQL database.
*   **Interactive Commit History Graph:** The visual centerpiece. A stunning, interactive force-directed graph of the repository's commit tree, built with D3.js, allowing users to pan, zoom, and explore the branching history.
*   **Contributor & Code Heatmaps:** Visual dashboards showing which contributors have had the most impact on which files and how collaboration patterns have evolved.
*   **Architectural Time-Lapse:** A feature that visualizes the growth and changes in the repository's file structure over time.

### Technology Stack (Proposed)
*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, D3.js, Tailwind CSS
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, GitHub API
*   **Deployment:** Docker, Vercel/Render
